<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The New Energy Vehicle Charger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DC Charging Pile</li><li>AC Charging Pile</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The New Energy Vehicle (NEV) charger market primarily consists of two types: DC charging piles and AC charging piles. DC (Direct Current) charging piles provide rapid charging by delivering high power directly to the vehicle's battery, significantly reducing charging time. In contrast, AC (Alternating Current) charging piles supply power that the vehicle's onboard charger converts, making them generally slower but often more cost-effective and suitable for home or public charging stations. Both types cater to different user needs and infrastructure requirements.</p></p>
