<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Stimulation Leads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar</li><li>Monopolar</li><li>Quadrupolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiac stimulation leads market consists of three main types: bipolar, monopolar, and quadrupolar leads. Bipolar leads feature two electrodes in close proximity, allowing for precise pacing with minimal energy loss. Monopolar leads, characterized by a single electrode and a distant reference point, are often easier to position but can produce more electrical interference. Quadrupolar leads incorporate four electrodes, enabling greater flexibility in pacing configurations and improved management of complex cardiac conditions, enhancing overall therapy effectiveness.</p></p>
