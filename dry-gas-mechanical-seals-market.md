<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Gas Mechanical Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contacting Gas Seal</li><li>Non-Contacting Gas Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Dry Gas Mechanical Seals market is primarily divided into two types: contacting gas seals and non-contacting gas seals. Contacting gas seals operate with a small gap between the sealing surfaces, providing a tight seal that prevents gas leakage but may experience wear over time. In contrast, non-contacting gas seals maintain a larger gap, utilizing gas film to create a barrier, resulting in minimal wear and extended service life. Both types are crucial in enhancing efficiency and reliability in various industrial applications.</p></p>
