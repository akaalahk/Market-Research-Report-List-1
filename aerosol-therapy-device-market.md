<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerosol Therapy Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs)</li><li>Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs)</li><li>Nebulizers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aerosol therapy devices are crucial for delivering medication to patients with respiratory conditions. Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs) provide a precise dose of medication in aerosol form, requiring coordination of inhalation and actuation. Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs) deliver medication in a powdered form, activated by the patient's inhalation, making them breath-activated. Nebulizers convert liquid medication into a mist, allowing for easy inhalation over longer periods, often used for those unable to use MDIs or DPIs effectively.</p></p>
