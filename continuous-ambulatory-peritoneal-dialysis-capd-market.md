<p><h1>Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) Market Size, and Examines its Market Scope, with a Primary Focus on Growth Opportunities, and Forecasted Trends Spanning from 2025 to 2032</h1></p><p><strong>Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) is a form of dialysis that allows patients with chronic kidney disease to perform their own dialysis treatment at home. It involves the use of a catheter inserted into the peritoneal cavity, where a sterile dialysate solution is infused. The solution absorbs waste products and toxins from the bloodstream and is then drained out, allowing for an efficient filtration process. CAPD provides patients with greater flexibility and independence compared to hemodialysis, as treatments can be done during the day without the need for specialized equipment or regular trips to a dialysis center.</p><p>The CAPD market is witnessing significant growth, driven by rising incidences of kidney-related ailments, increasing awareness about home-based dialysis options, and advancements in dialysis technology. Moreover, the growing geriatric population and the rising healthcare expenditures are further enhancing market prospects. The Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.5% during the forecast period. Recent trends include the introduction of user-friendly devices, improved automated systems, and an increasing focus on patient education and support services to enhance adherence and outcomes in home dialysis therapy.</p></p>
