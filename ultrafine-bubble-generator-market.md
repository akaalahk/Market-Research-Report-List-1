<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrafine Bubble Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas-Water Circulation Type</li><li>Pressurized Dissolution Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ultrafine bubble generator market can be divided into two main types: gas-water circulation type and pressurized dissolution type. The gas-water circulation type utilizes a process where gas is mixed with water in a continuous flow, producing tiny bubbles that enhance water properties. Conversely, the pressurized dissolution type involves increasing pressure to dissolve gas directly into the water, creating ultrafine bubbles. Both methods are used across various applications, including aquaculture, wastewater treatment, and industrial processes, to improve efficiency and efficacy.</p></p>
